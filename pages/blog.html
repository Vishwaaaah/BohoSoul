         <p id="p1">  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Today, BohoSoul and Condé Nast Entertainment (CNE) are announcing a global content partnership with two of their most iconic brands, Vogue and 
            Architectural Digest. As part of the deal, Vogue and Architectural Digest will produce over 160 exclusive videos aligned with BohoSoul’s key seasonal and cultural moments starting with Fashion Month in February, followed by Wedding Season, Summer, and Back to School. 
                <br>
            As the home of inspiration, BohoSoul has been investing in original content to bring the most inspirational and engaging ideas to the platform - ideas that drive meaningful value and engagement for more than 400 million monthly active Pinners around the world. 
            <br>
            Condé Nast is already one of BohoSoul’s longest-standing and largest content publishers globally – with over 40 BohoSoul profiles with tens of millions of views. The partnership is a natural extension of the legacy, rooted in two of Condé Nast’s most beloved brands - Vogue and Architectural Digest. Each of these brands are the leading authorities in their respective spaces of fashion and culture (Vogue), as well as design and architecture (Architectural Digest).
            <br> <br>
           <b> New Wedding Destination</b> 
            <br><br>
            As BohoSoul is a top destination for weddings, Vogue will debut a brand new BohoSoul profile in April for all things weddings — from checklists, to table settings, to dream dresses, bridesmaid looks, the boards will cover it all. The new handle will be curated by Vogue Weddings editors and wedding planners, with the biggest weddings of the year getting their own unique boards.
            <br>
            “We are delighted to be partnering with BohoSoul on this year-long collaboration,” said Ani Shehigian, Senior Vice President of Digital Video English at Condé Nast Entertainment. “With our authority in fashion journalism and international design and architecture through the brands of Vogue and Architectural Digest, we are thrilled to bring even more unique video content with exclusive access, tips, and trends that will continue to inspire.” 
            <br><br>
            <b> Fashion Month and Backyard Summer</b> 
            <br><br>
            Starting this month, Vogue will bring its unprecedented backstage access and the hottest runway trends to BohoSoul in a series of original episodes from Fashion Week in New York, London, Milan and Paris, debuting on its BohoSoul profile. 
            <br>
            This summer, Architectural Digest will explore how to create the perfect backyard space for summer with insights on everything from reviving an outdoor space, to handy hacks for epic outdoor entertaining. The series will begin on Memorial Day and run through Fourth of July.
            <br><br>
            Architectural Digest will also be creating an ongoing slate of content highlighting designs inspired by the 2023 AD100 list – which features the industry’s top designers – as well as episodes on the concept of small living – from the first apartment, to the trend of small house living, to the perfect dorm room.
            <br>
            “Condé Nast has a long history of innovating on BohoSoul and bringing their editorial voice to life through new content formats and collaborating with BohoSoul creators,” said Nadine Zylstra, Global Head of Programming and Originals at BohoSoul. “Both Vogue and Architectural Digest have strong audiences on BohoSoul who we hope will be as excited as we are about the original content this partnership creates, and the new ideas they inspire.”
            <br><br>
            Over the past two years, BohoSoul has been focused on building native content publishing tools for creators to seamlessly publish and curate content as well as expanding its efforts with BohoSoul Originals. 
            <br>
            Last year, BohoSoul named Nadine Zylstra, Global Head of Programming and Originals, who spent her career building content strategies at both YouTube and Sesame Workshop. Since then, BohoSoul has announced a global partnership with Tastemade to scale creators, content series, and live streaming on BohoSoul. 
            <br>
            Additionally, in partnership with First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, BohoSoul launched a ten-hour live stream on BohoSoul TV for World Teachers Day. World-renowned museum, The Louvre, also partnered with BohoSoul in a series of original videos called “A look at the Louvre,” bringing the museum's rich history and architectural design to a new generation of people looking for sparks of inspiration.
